## Motivation
We know there exist:
 - The orignal one and good `rCharts` 
 - https://github.com/jcizel/highchartR
 - https://github.com/metagraf/rHighcharts

Anyway, I want to try to get all the HC API funcionalities in this package. That is: Every chart in http://www.highcharts.com/demo you can do it in R (may be there will be some exceptions like [this](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/combo-timeline)).

Basically is write the json parameter in via R and get similar funcionalities that exists in https://github.com/hrbrmstr/metricsgraphics

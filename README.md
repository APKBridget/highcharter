**highcharter is in active development**. So there functions in the package can be renamed,
modified , or deleted. I will ensure have the minimum impact.

## Why highcharter?

- [Various](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/#shorcuts-for-add-data-data-series) chart type with the same style (scatters, time series, heatmaps, treemap, more coming soon).
- [Themes](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/#themes): Add themes, merge themes or create your own.
- [Piping styling](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/#quick-demo).
- Support [Highstock charts](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/#xts-objects-and-quantmod-package). You can create a candlestick charts in 2 lines of code. Support `xts` objects from the quantmod package.
- Have [*ggfortify*-like](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) funcionalities. This is chart a lot
of **R** objects with `hchart(x)`. character, factors, ts, mts, xts, ohlc, dist will be supported.
